Jekyll automatically converts Markdown documents to HTML. Markdown is a plain
text format for writing structured documents, such as those with sections and
lists. Many excellent tutorials exist to learn Markdown, such as CommonMark's
[10 Minute Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

This template uses the base Jekyll theme, Minima. You can find out more
information about customizing the Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage
documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).
